### Greetings my stalkers! 👋
- :blue_heart: I'm a UofT student studying math & stats. I'm interning at Epson Canada and I'm also a TA for stats courses.
- :purple_heart: I’m currently learning R, constructing R packages and designing an R Shiny website
- :no_mouth: If it isn't obvious, I am a compelete GitHub n00b. Why am I ranked A+? No idea.
- :shit: Fun fact: In my spare time I draw and write bad fanfiction.
